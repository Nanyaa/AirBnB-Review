## Installations

## Project Motivation
Analysing Seattle and Boston AirBnB to answer questions using the CRISP-DM Process. I used the Seattle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?select=reviews.csv) and Boston(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston?select=reviews.csv) AirBnB datasets from Kaggle. I wanted to better understand:

- What is the distribution of prices in Boston and Seattle respectively?
- When is the busiest season in Boston and Seattle respectively?
- Do busy seasons affect price in Boston and Seattle respectively?
- What areas are most common in Boston and Seattle respectively?
- Where are the best reviewed AirBnBs located?

## File Descriptions
